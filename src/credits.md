BORIS is developed entirely with open source software.

BORIS is developped in [Python 3.10](http://www.python.org) using [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI (should run from Python >= 3.8).  
The [mpv media player](https://mpv.io) library and the [python-mpv](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv) interface are used to play media files.  
The `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`\_ python 2D plotting library
  is used for plotting events and generating the spectrogram.

The `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`\_ data analysis tool.


The `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org>`\_ multimedia framework is used
  to extract media files parameters, in frame-by-frame mode and in
  spectrogram visualization.

The `Tablib <https://tablib.readthedocs.org>`\_ Python module is used
  to export data in TSV, CSV, ODS, XLSX, HTML and XLS formats.

The `portion <https://pypi.org/project/portion>`\_ Python module is
  used in the **Advanced event filtering** function.

The `ExifRead <https://pypi.org/project/ExifRead>`\_ Python module
  used to access pictures Exif data.

The `pyreadr <https://pypi.org/project/pyreadr>`\_ Python module is
  used to save data for R (optionally).

The `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`\_ graph visualization
  software is used (optionally) to generate transitions graph.

The BORIS web site is made using
  `Pelican <https://blog.getpelican.com>`\_ static site generator and
  supported by GitHub.
